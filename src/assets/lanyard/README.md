# Lanyard Assets

This directory should contain:

- `card.glb` - The 3D model file for the card
- `lanyard.png` - The texture file for the lanyard band

## How to get these files:

1. Download `card.glb` and `lanyard.png` from the original repository
2. Place them in this directory
3. You can edit the card.glb file using: https://modelviewer.dev/editor/
4. You can edit the lanyard.png texture in any image editor

## Temporary placeholders:

The current implementation uses placeholder files that will need to be replaced with the actual assets.
